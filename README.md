# NumVis

A simple application for visualising numbers. It maps digits to
a colour that has a proportionate hue when mapped to the range
of 0.0 - 1.0. 

Typical operation:
`java NumVis [your number]`

Reading from files:
`java NumVis path:/path/to/your/file.txt`

I plan on adding more styles of visualisation and ensuring 
particular input cases are handled better.
